# Webapp boilerplate

This template uses Angular, Bootstrap and Auth0 to provide for the basic foundation for a typical Single Page Web 
Application with the Authentication ready to go.


## Configuring Auth0

After having set up your client on Auth0, rename `src/app/services/auth/auth0-variables.ts.example` to 
`src/app/services/auth/auth0-variables.ts` and set your `clientID` and `domain` variables

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change 
any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use 
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
